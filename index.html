    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
     Hi, my name is Caroline Baumann and I am a geospatial researcher. I recently graduated from California State University, Northridge (CSUN) with my M.S. in Geographic Information Science. Prior to that, I graduated from CSUN with dual degrees in Geography and Deaf Studies. I currently work at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as the JPL Center Lead for NASA's DEVELOP program. I am also engaged in ongoing research about neighborhood satisfaction in Australia with William V. A. Clark at UCLA. Curently, I serve as the GIS Consultant for the New Earth Regeneration Initiative (http://www.ner-i.org/). I am interested in a variety of research topics including Deaf Culture, American Sign Language, Spatial Accessibility, MultiCriteria Decision Analysis, Cartographic Design, and Remote Sensing.

      <h3>ECOSTRESS Tutorials</h3>
      <p>The ECOSTRESS tutorials are a set of written and video tutorials designed to guide users through the very basics of installing software, to downloading data, and applying it with some simple codes. This aligns with NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) goal of broadening science to a wider audience and lowers the barrier to entry for those interested in accessing ECOSTRESS data. The tutorials have a written and video version to accommodate a variety of learning styles. Some tutorials also have associated code that is stored in the ECOSTRESS tutorials GitHub, where we invite users to provide suggestions on how it can be improved. Additionally, I developed a template and workflow for these tutorials so that other ECOSTRESS employees can make their own tutorials based on the work they are doing or as a response to the needs of the working group.<br>

      <h3>Calculating Spatial Accessibility to Primary Healthcare Providers in Yucatán, Mexico</h3>
      <p>This project examined spatial accessibility to primary healthcare facilities in the state of Yucatán, Mexico by employing the Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method. Access to primary healthcare plays an important role in enhancing overall health outcomes, especially due to preventative care measures. 2SFCA was used to first calculate a provider-to-population ratio using network analysis, and then aggregate these ratios within population catchment areas. The end result is a spatial accessibility index, which is a valuable metric to evaluate relative spatial accessibility of population points to primary healthcare locations. This research helps quantify accessibility, with potential applications aiding in policy development and service planning, ultimately resulting in improved health outcomes for the population.</p>

      <h3>Quantifying Potential Spatial Accessibility to Adult American Sign Language Classes in Los Angeles County</h3>
      <p>This research examines potential spatial accessibility to adult American Sign Language (ASL) learning opportunities in Los Angeles County by employing the Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method. Over 90% of all deaf children are born to hearing parents, who typically do not know sign language. Research has shown that deaf children whose parents learn sign language tend to have better outcomes than those who do not. Thus, adult accessibility to sign language classes is crucial for the success of deaf children. The findings show high accessibility in Lancaster-Palmdale, the San Fernando Valley, and Long Beach, while showing low accessibility in the Santa Monica Mountains and Central Los Angeles.<br>

      <h3>Southern California Water Resources - Using NASA Earth Observations to Monitor Seagrass Extent and Water Quality Parameters</h3>
      <p>This project investigated water quality parameters associated with eelgrass in Newport Bay and Mission Bay, California. Using satellite data from Landsat 8 & 9, Sentinel-2, and ECOSTRESS, we created time series of turbidity, sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll-a concentration from 2019–2023. These data revealed cyclical seasonal trends, with peaks in turbidity and temperature in the summer. This research helps support ecosystem monitoring efforts. <br>

  <strong>JPL Center Lead - NASA DEVELOP, Analytical Mechanics Associates, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</strong><br>
  <em>Supervisor: Ben Holt | January 2025 - Present</em>
  <p>I am the head of the NASA DEVELOP program at the JPL node. This means I manage all programmatic involvement at the node. My primary responsibility is to oversee teams of interns throughout a 10-week project term to make sure their projects are successful and that they build capacity in professional and personal skills. I am also responsible for sourcing project ideas by finding and networking with outside organizations in need of satellite data analysis. With the partner needs in mind, I network with JPL employees and academics to find scientists who are interested in collaborating on the project. For each project, I write a proposal where I outline the Earth observations we will use, the analysis we will conduct, and the end products we aim to hand off to the partners in the end. At the end of the term, I facilitate the hand off of high quality deliverables including data visualizations, technical reports, and presentations to the organizations who benefit from this information. Finally, in this role I am tasked with filtering through large volumes of applications, and interviewing those selected to hire suitable participants. Through this role I have gained skills including professional communication with outside partners, strong technical writing skills, hiring skills, project management capabilities, and also technical skills as I help participants with code and GIS analysis in their projects.

  <strong>Statistics Specialist - University of California, Los Angeles</strong><br>
  <em>Supervisor: Dr. William A.V. Clark | October 2024 - Present</em>
  <p>In this position, I analyze data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. My supervisor and I are interested in understanding how older people in Australia feel about their neighborhoods and communities. Serving as the statistics specialist for the project, I have been writing code in R to clean and organize data, sort for null values, categorize data, and run analysis such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression. I also use R for data visualization by making various plots and histograms to further investigate the distributions and correlations of the data.</p>

  <strong>Student Research Assistant - California State University, Northridge</strong><br>
  <em>Supervisor: Dr. Soheil Boroushaki | May 2023 - January 2025</em>
  <p>I was a research assistant in collaboration with National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) where I worked on 2 projects in the state of Yucatan. The first investigated Spatial Accessibility to primary healthcare providers using the 2 Step Floating Catchment Area Method (2SFCA). The second focused on identifying disadvantaged communities using GIS based Multi Criteria Decision Analysis with the CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) weighting methods. I was the primary GIS technician on this project and completed the analysis using ArcGIS Pro and Python scripts in Jupyter Notebook. I also created map projects, presentations, and posters that I presented at the American Association of Geographers (AAG) and the CSUNposium. Finally, I was able to present my work at three universities in Mexico, two in Yucatan and one in Mexico City. This allowed me to gain experience working with locals to validate and improve on quantitative GIS work. Lastly, I gained proposal writing experience for these projects as well as for one on creating a walkability index for Mexico City to compare to Los Angeles.

  <strong>Science Communication Intern - NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech</strong><br>
  <em>Supervisor: Gregory Halverson | June 2024 - December 2024</em>
  <p>I was brought on to the ECOSTRESS team to create tutorials to educate the public on how to access and apply this data. Without any additional guidance, I developed a comprehensive set of tutorials that can guide users throughout the whole process from installing necessary applications, accessing and downloading data, and finally processing and visualizing it. My main focus was developing training material, code, and tutorials. I gained hands-on experience in writing detailed instructions to explain complex remote sensing concepts as I created written tutorials. I successfully developed Python code to cloud mask, apply QC flags, filter, and sharpen ECOSTRESS data. For every written tutorial, I also produced a video tutorial demonstrating the process. Finally, I developed templates and workflows that I used to teach other scientists and colleges how to develop their own user-friendly tutorials.

  <strong>Participant, Technical Lead - NASA DEVELOP, Analytical Mechanics Associates, JPL</strong><br>
  <em>Supervisor: Michael Pazmino | January 2024 - April 2024</em>
  <p>My NASA DEVELOP project focused on researching water quality parameters and their relationship to eelgrass in Newport and Mission Bay using NASA’s Earth Observations. We partnered with the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) to create workflows for assessing the quality of water in inland bays using remotely sensed imagery to use in addition to their ground data measurements. I stepped in as the technical lead by developing code in both Python and JavaScript for Google Earth Engine to generate water quality datasets from Landsat 8 & 9, Sentinel-2, and ECOSTRESS data. I investigated chlorophyll-a, turbidity, and surface temperature to track their changes over time. I created time series animations to visualize spatiotemporal variations in the data. Finally, the team conducted an accuracy assessment in R to assess variations in accuracy between satellite derived and in-situ measurements.

  <strong>Python Specialist - Center for Geospatial Science and Technology</strong><br>
  <em>Supervisor: Joel Osuna-Williams | April 2023 - January 2024</em>
  <p>I specialized in developing Python scripts to read, modify, organize, and analyze spatial data. My primary client was the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and I mainly focused on synthesizing data from Bottomhole Pressure (BHP) reports that were digitized by other interns. Through this project, I took initiative to develop a workflow to parse out lithologic descriptors from the abbreviated descriptors in the written reports. This required me to learn about various machine learning techniques to understand the best way to approach this task. I was also the head of the Sea Floor Mapping project for BOEM which primarily involved sorting through various geographic datasets to aggregate like data and improve upon existing metadata. My training also included Elevation-Derived Hydrography (EDH) workflows.
